Hello World!
Hi Miranda,

I would love to come back—thank you so much for giving me another opportunity to return to Stifel and continue to learn and grow. This internship has been an incredible experience and has exceeded my expectations in so many ways.

I just had one quick question for clarification: would I be returning on days when I don’t have class throughout the school year, or only during school breaks? I will be graduating in May 2026, and I’m happy to adjust my schedule however is needed—I will definitely find a way to make it work.

Once again, thank you for this opportunity. I’m really looking forward to continuing to be part of the team at Stifel.

Best regards,
Kaleb Woldetsadik
