Hello World!
I had a great mentorship experience this summer with Matt Frederick and Chris Bunselmeyer. Although Chris was officially one of my mentors, our interaction was mainly during my first week as he helped me get set up and shared helpful onboarding videos. Since he was on a different team, we didnâ€™t work closely after that.

My primary mentor was Matt with Team G-Force. Matt was incredibly knowledgeable and supportive. Anytime I had a question, he either had an immediate answer or guided me to the solution. I also noticed that he was a valuable resource to the entire team, always stepping in to assist wherever needed. His mentorship made my learning process smooth and helped me quickly adapt to the work environment.

Overall, I really appreciated how approachable and helpful my mentors were. Their support allowed me to learn a lot and contribute effectively throughout the internship.
