Hello World!
I wanted to share my current fall schedule so we can see how it aligns with the internship:
	•	Monday: Free all day
	•	Tuesday & Thursday: 10:00–11:15 AM and 1:30–2:40 PM classes
	•	Wednesday: 12:00–1:15 PM and 2:00–2:50 PM classes (I am working on freeing this day)
	•	Friday: 12:00–1:15 PM and 3:00–3:50 PM classes

If I am able to free up Wednesdays, I will have both Monday and Wednesday completely open.

I am happy to work around this schedule in any way that is most helpful for the team. Please let me know what works best for you, and I’m excited to continue contributing to the team.

Thank you again for this opportunity.

Best regards,
Kaleb Woldetsadik
